# Blackjack

This is one of my project for Programming and Elementary Data Structures course at Shanghai Jiao Tong University. I implement a simplified version of the card game called Blackjack, also sometimes called 21.

## About Honor Code
If there are same questions or projects in the future, it is the responsibility of JI students not to copy or modify these codes, or TeX files because it is against the Honor Code. The owner of this repository dosen't take any commitment for other's faults.

According to the student handbook (2015 version),
> It is a violation of the Honor Code for students to submit, as their own, work that is not the result of their own labor and thoughts. This applies, in particular, to ideas, expressions or work obtained from other students as well as from books, the internet, and other sources. The failure to properly credit ideas, expressions or work from others is considered plagiarism.
